## Reference genome nomenclature
- hgX is nomenclature from UCSC, while GRChX is from the GRC (Genome Reference Consortium).
- Equivalent reference genome versions
  - CRCh38, hg38 (2013)
  - GRCh37, hg19 (2009)
  - NCBI36, hg18 (2006)
  - NCBI35, hg17 (2004)
  - NCBI34, hg16 (2003)

## Ensembl vs. GENCODE vs. RefSeq
- Ensembl, GENCODE, and RefSeq are **gene annotations** (i.e. specify what genes are called and where they are located on a reference genome) published by different organizations. They are different from the reference genomes themselves.
